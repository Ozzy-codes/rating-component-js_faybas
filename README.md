## My process
- Analyse the goal and see how to get there
- First build the rating page then figure how to connect it to the thank you page
- Figure out media query for screen sizes coz I still find it hard

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
function myFunction() {
window.location.href = "thanks.html";
}
```

### Continued development

- Need to polish up my Javascript
- Screen sizes, screen sizes, screen sizes
